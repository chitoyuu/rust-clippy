### What it does

Checks for float operations not required to be reproducible operations (Clause 5) by
the IEEE 754-2008 standard.

### Why is this bad?

`std` implementations of math functions are system-dependent, and may also change between
versions. This may lead to slightly different results when the same calculation is
carried out on different machines.

For some applications like game networking, it can be desirable to avoid accidentally
performing non-reproducible operations, when the developer has opted into using a specific
implementation such as the [`libm`][libm] crate instead.

### Example
```
1.0_f32.sin();
```
